# DifferentialEvolotionCpp
## Simple Differential Evolution example for function minimalizing i C++

## DifferentialEvolution.h is where the magic happens.
## FunctionToOpt.h is the file with object of functions to be optimalized.
### You can add your own functions if needed by simpley inheriting the virtual class and overwriting evaluateFitness function.
## diferential_evolution.cpp is just an exaple of usage.

## Comments are unfortunetly in Polish, becouse it was an assignment from university (West Pomeranian Technical University, Szczecin).

# Feel free to clone and send pull requests, all of them will be welcomed.
